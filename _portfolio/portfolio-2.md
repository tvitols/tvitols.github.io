Made as a final project for CS 2210, this was a group project focused on using a Raspberry PI. It features three main components: a robotic arm for manipulating the cards, a machine vision system to recognize card values, and a webserver/client for playing the game.

A more thorough description of the project can be found [here](/files/PCMI_FinalReport.pdf)
