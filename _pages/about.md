## Hey, I'm Tov!

I am currently studying Computer Science and Linguistics.

I maintain websites for a few local organizations and occasionally do some Android app development.

I focus mainly on backend development but have experience with fullstack, app dev, and Arduino development as well.

This site is currently a fairly stock fork of [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). While I am using this space to connect with other developers, my main goal is to simply explore and learn. This site will hopefully become more unique as time goes on.
